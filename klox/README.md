- [ ] What happens right now if you divide a number by zero? What do you think should happen? Justify your choice. How do other languages you know handle division by zero, and why do they make the choices they do?
- [ ] Many languages define + such that if either operand is a string, the other is converted to a string and the results are then concatenated. For example, "scone" + 4 would yield scone4. Extend the code in visitBinaryExpr() to support that.
- [ ] Add support for the C-style conditional or “ternary” operator ?:. What precedence level is allowed between the ? and :? Is the whole operator left-associative or right-associative?
- [ ] Add error productions to handle each binary operator appearing without a left-hand operand. In other words, detect a binary operator appearing at the beginning of an expression. Report that as an error, but also parse and discard a right-hand operand with the appropriate precedence.

- [ ] Remove comma operator
- [ ] Add where expressions
  -     // expression -> expression
